# CS305-Software-Security

    Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
      Artemis Financial is a theoretical consulting firm that creates plans for savings, retirement, insurance, etc. They operated on a web based platform and were looking for us to update their security to modern specifications. The main focus was on implementing a file verification checker and a way of creating secure encrypted messages for the client-server communication.
    
    What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
      I think I identified the proper security cipher for their style of application rather well. It took me a while to look through several of them to figure out which was the best, but in the end I made the right choice. It is incredibly important to code securely no matter what kind of application you are creating. When you leave vulnerabilities and bad syntax in your code you allow hackers of many calibers to manipulate and possibly destroy the application you spent so long creating. In addition, users who use your application are left vulnerable to having their own information stolen leaving you in a legal bind.
    
    What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
      I found the manual code review to be very challenging on every assignment. When we were looking at the code for vulnerabilities I wasn't entirely sure what I was looking for, even after re-reading everything we had and looking up common vulnerabilities. I feel accomplish in the vulnerabilities I did find, however I understand I need more practice with it.
    
    How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
      When told what area we would be working on, I researched the topic we were learning that week to find any additional information I could. Outside of said research I re-read sections of our book when I would get confused on what techniques to work with.
    
    How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
      When refactoring the code I made sure to constantly test to see if the application was still able to run and fixed any errors that occured. To make sure vulnerabilities were not added I did an initial vulnerability test to see what already existed, and then did a follow-up test after the refactoring was completed.
    
    What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
      I used all the resources given to us in class such as the book and different reference sites, along with eclipse, maven, and java. When it comes to coding practices I have been following the same practices I was taught when I initially learned the language. This far into my education these practices have kept me safe and error free, so I intend to continue following them until I learned something better.
    
    Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
      I would want to showcase the encryption messaging I put in place for this project. I know it's still rather simple in how it is made, but I feel like it shows I can learn how to implement a new cipher or algorithm to accomplish any goal my employer may need. It also shows that what I create will be secure and functional rather than glitchy and error filled.
